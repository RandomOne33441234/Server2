<h1>This is the page that is dedicated to da lun</h1>

  <img src="photos\LUN1.jpg" position="absolute" left="0px" down="400px"width="400" height="400" alt="Lun Stares Into Your Soul As You Begin To Question Your Life ASMR">
  <p>    in this image the lun is aggressively sitting on the bench this is because she is angry at the fact that
  her friend woodie hasnt shown his face in years, and she is begining to think that he may
  have left her, this is however making her sad</p>
<img src="photos\LUN2.jpg" position="relative" left="0px" width="400" height="400" alt="Luna Sits aggressively on the floor">
<p  class="newtest"> in this image the luns vibe is quite honestly rancid, this is causing her to get very sad
  <br> perhaps she needs a bath (anger) this should be a last ditch effort as she dose not appreciate
  the bath time</p>
  <img src="photos\LUN3.jpg"  position="absolute" left="0px" width="400" height="400" alt="Luna pauses momentaitly to watch a bird, being caught off guard for the first time ever">
<p>
  in this image we see the true divisions in the luns character, she does indeed enjoy the biscuits, however she also would enjoy
  to do some of the killing action, preferably on the darc, this further contribtes to the hypothesis that the lun
  is a heavily conflicted individual, struggling with the constraints of society that hold her back.

<p class="newtest">
  ngl this image is perhaps the most intense battle of wills that the world has ever seen, in the white and orange corner we
  have darcy, the newcomer, who has already proven herself to be a capable fighter, when she single handedly took on
  the scary white cat (hate), however her aggression is matched if not outdone by the ferocious might of the lun,
  who will prevail??!!
